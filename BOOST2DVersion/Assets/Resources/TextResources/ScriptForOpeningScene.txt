You mean like GPS?"
Trig1
F
Ha, ha, ha, Oh stupid child. In my facility the speed of light in the horizontal directions is slowed to a crawl.  We see first hand the distortions caused by Special Relativity!
Trig1
F
In order to determine whether or not you have the right stuff to work with me on these exciting projects, I've set up a few simple trials to test your understanding of special relativity.
Trig1
J
What if don't have the 'the right stuff''?
Trig1
F
Then we have a very talented janitorial staff  to clean you off the lab floor.
Trig1
J
So you're saying I either get the job or die trying?
Trig1
F
Of course not, do you think I'm some kind of monster?  You can leave right now!  
Trig1
F
But be honest, can you really afford to turn down a job in this economy?"

Jenny eventually got a postdoctoral position at a second tier research institution.  Before continuing on to a fulfilling career as a professor of physics at a small college.  

Sometimes she wondered about the  mysterious Dr. Friz's Institute,  but mostly enjoyed a healthy work  life balance free of potentially fatal tests.

Seriously this is the lame ending, why download the game if you were just going to bail in the starting scene? Congratulations on winning I guess, but come on, why not actually try some of the puzzles?  Jenny's not actually a real person, just because she dies in the game, doesn't mean she's actually hurt.
